    <p id="aboutParagraph"> Welcome to the About Me page, below I am going to briefly describe myself and my education recently:</p>
    
    <p class="Description"> My name is Callum Maxwell and I am 24 years old. I am a big Wigan Athletic and St Helens rugby fan. My recent education was studying BTEC Level 3 IT at St John Rigby where I studied from 2015 to 2018 and achieved a DDM grade. I then attended Liverpool Hope University where I studied a BSc in Computer Science from 2018 until 2022 and achieved a Third Class degree.</p>
